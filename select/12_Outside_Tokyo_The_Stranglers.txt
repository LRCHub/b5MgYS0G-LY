Somewhere outside Tokyo
Invented time
Someone in a factory
Invented time
If people wanted proof to carry on
They'd like to buy one

Fifty million watches
With a strap to sell
Fifty million watches
With a strap to sell
If people wanted proof to carry on
They'd like to buy one

If they should ever sell out
That would be the end of time
