Bristol Sound City '95, Anson Rooms - 17/4/95

You're so merry up on high,
Oh so scarily on high
Gloria never ever cries,
'Cos she's just too busy
Gloria never shuts her eyes,
'Cos it makes her dizzy
Now you've got it all,
What do you want it for
All that noise you got,
Do you still want more
You're a strange girl, Gloria
You say you've got it all,
What do you want it for
All that noise you got,
Well you're just a whore
You're a sick girl, Gloria
Oh so scary up on high
You say you've got it all,
What do you want it for
All that noise you got,
Well you're still a whore
You're a sick girl, Gloria
You say you've got it all,
What do you want it for
All that noise you got,
Do you still want more
You're a strange girl, Gloria,
Hosanna in excelsis
